# YagiWifi
Yagi antenna for wifi 2.4Ghz with 10.5dB Gain, modelled in HFSS and then created the prototype.


This is the HFSS Model:

This is the Real and immaginary Impedence of the antenna:

As we can see in the HFSS simulation the antenna will have 10.5dB of Gain, this is the radiation graph:

this is the S11 (Scattering seen from port 1)

And this is the created model:

And results with the original Alpha antenna of 5dB and with the Yagi Uda antenna
